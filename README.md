This is the paper for Miccai Challenge 2022ï¼ŒCMRxMotion,published [at](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23443-9_47)   
I trained all the nnUnet-based models mentioned in this paper and I'm also a co-author of it.  
However,the code and training parameters may not be public.  
To reproduce the performance, you need to fine tune the parameters and revise the classic nnUnet structure based on the methods mentioned in this paper.
